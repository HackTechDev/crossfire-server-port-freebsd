Crossfire server has been installed.

IMPORTANT:
Configuration files are installed as *.sample files and MUST be copied
before starting the server, otherwise Crossfire will fail to start.

To initialize the configuration, run as root:

  for f in ${PREFIX}/etc/crossfire/*.sample; do
    base="${f%.sample}"
    [ -e "$base" ] || cp "$f" "$base"
  done

Configuration directory:
  ${PREFIX/etc/crossfire/

Runtime data directory:
  /var/crossfire

You may now start the server with:
  crossfire-server


Maps are required to run the server.
The server expects them in:
  ${PREFIX/share/crossfire/maps/

If you did not install maps, please install the crossfire-maps package/port.
